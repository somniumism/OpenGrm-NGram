  * Compatibility with OpenFst version 1.5.1 (1.2.2)

OpenGrm NGram - Release 1.1
  * Substantially refactored code to allow for easy distributed model building.
  * Included a 'convenience' shell script bin/ngram.sh that runs some common
    pipelines of commands, e.g., from text file to pruned language model.
    Shell script provides illustration of distributed model building utilities.
  * Functions to re-estimate smoothed n-gram models to impose marginal
    distribution constraints.

OpenGrm NGram - Release 1.0
  * Initial public release
